    <p>1. Scoring Versatility
      <br>
Shooting: SFs should have a reliable outside shot (both mid-range and three-point shooting) to stretch defenses.
      <br>
Driving to the Basket: Be able to attack the rim effectively, using speed and strength to finish through contact.
      <br>
Finishing in Traffic: Small forwards often finish layups and dunks in crowded areas, so strong finishing ability is crucial.
      <br>
Post-up Game: Some SFs, especially taller ones, need to have a low-post game to take advantage of mismatches.
      <br>

2. Ball Handling
      <br>
Handling in Transition: SFs often lead or participate in fast breaks, so ball-handling at high speed is important.
      <br>
1-on-1 Moves: Be able to break down defenders with moves like crossovers, spin moves, and step-backs to create scoring opportunities.
      <br>

3. Rebounding
      <br>
Offensive and Defensive Rebounding: SFs are often tasked with helping secure rebounds on both ends of the floor. They should be aggressive and use their size and athleticism to compete for rebounds.
      <br>
Boxing Out: Knowing how to position oneself to grab rebounds by boxing out opposing players is key.
