    <p>1. Shooting Ability
     <br>
Mid-range and Three-point Shooting: Shooting guards should excel at making shots from both mid-range and beyond the arc.
     <br>
Catch-and-Shoot: Be able to quickly catch the ball and release a shot under pressure.
     <br>
Free-throw Shooting: Shooting guards often draw fouls, so consistent free-throw shooting is vital.
     <br>

2. Ball Handling
     <br>
Dribbling under Pressure: SGs need to handle the ball well, especially when moving through defenders.
     <br>
Crossover and Hesitation Dribbles: These moves help create space for shooting or driving to the basket.
     <br>

3. Off-the-ball Movement
     <br>
Cutting to the Basket: Move effectively without the ball to get open for easy shots or layups.
     <br>
Using Screens: Know how to read and use screens to free yourself from defenders and create good shooting angles.
